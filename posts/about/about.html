	<p>Thoughts and experiments on artificial neural networks</p>
	<small>Published on 2 May 2016</small>
	<hr>
	<p>Hy, I'm writing this post because I want to share some experiments on artificial neural 
	networks that I'm doing in my free time. I have been using artificial neural networks
	for about a year now and I successfully used a convolutional neural network to find and 
	recognize cars license plates from images. 
	<br>Recently I started to think about the differences between biological and artificial neural networks
	because I believe that the field of artificial intelligence have a lot to learn from 
	the biological nervous system.
	Although there has been great progress in this field in recent years,
	there are some big problems yet to solve.
	</p>
	<p>
	One of the biggest problems of ANN is <b>generalization</b>, infact ANN are pretty bad at generalizing
	what they learn, you need a lot of data to make them work well.
	Also they are very very <b>slow</b> at learning new things compared to the Human brain, for
	example Humans are able to learn to recognizing an object by watching it one or few times
	while ANN require training on hundreds or thousands of images.
	I will talk a bit more about this problem later in this post and I will explain why I believe
	we are able to learns new things so quickly and why current ANN are not able to do that.
	Another problem in current artificial neural networks is that they can't be extended in an efficient
	way. For example let's say I want to train an ANN to recognize handwritten digits but I
	decide to train it only with images of numbers and without images of letters. I will end up
	with a network that is able to recognize numbers but not letters obviously.
	Let's say now that I changed my mind and I want to train the same network to recognize
	letters and numbers, so I train the network with images of letters.
	This time I end up with an ANN that is able to recognize letters but not numbers infact the
	problem is that the network overwrite what he had learned before.
	The common approach is to train the network with all the data at the same time but that it's
	not the way biological nervous systems works, we are able to learn new things without the need
	of forgetting other things.
